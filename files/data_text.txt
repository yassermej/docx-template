	"device_description": "The 16ch Shoulder Coil is a receive-only phased array RF coil designed for optimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and uniform coverage of the shoulder anatomy for use with GE Healthcare Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners. The coil receives magnetic resonance signals generated in hydrogen nuclei (protons) in the shoulder while blocking the high-frequency magnetic field applied by the MRI scanner at specified timings.
	The received signals are amplified before being transferred to the MRI scanner through the coil’s system cable. The amplified signals are processed into tomographic images of the shoulder anatomy by the MRI scanner.
	Images are typically generated as axial, sagittal, coronal oblique slices and include coverage of the Humerus, Humeral Head, Labrum, Labral Tear, Glenoid, Scapula, Clavicle, and Rotator Cuff regions of the shoulder anatomy.
	During a shoulder MRI exam, the patient lays in the supine position on the MRI scanner table. The rigid Posterior Array is positioned beneath the patient’s affected shoulder. The flexible Anterior Array is positioned on top of the patient’s affected shoulder. The 16ch Shoulder Posterior Housing Pad and 16ch Shoulder Pad provided with the coil promote patient comfort and facilitate patient positioning. Table Straps provided with the MRI scanner may be used to minimize unintended patient movement during the exam. Illustration of the architecture of the 16ch Shoulder Coil is shown in Figure 1.",
